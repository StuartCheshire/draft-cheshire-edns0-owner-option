	<abstract>
		<t>The DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service
		uses a message format identical to that used by standard DNS Update,
		with two additional pieces of information: the identity of the sleeping
		server to which the records belong, and the Wake-on-LAN Magic Packet
		bit pattern which should be used to wake the sleeping server. This document
		specifies the EDNS0 option used to carry that additional information.</t>

	<section title="Introduction">
		<t>The EDNS0 'Owner' Option is used by the DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service.
		The DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service <xref target="mDNS"/> <xref target="DNS-SD"/>
		uses a message format identical to that used by standard DNS Update
		<xref target="RFC2136"/> <xref target="RFC3007"/>,
		with two additional pieces of information: the identity of the sleeping
		server to which the records belong, and the Wake-on-LAN Magic Packet <xref target="WoL"/>
		bit pattern which should be used to wake the sleeping server. This document
		specifies the EDNS0 option <xref target="RFC2671"/> used to carry that
		additional information.</t>

		<t>The EDNS0 'Owner' Option is specified here with reference to the
		DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service, but could also be used for other purposes not
		related to the Sleep Proxy Service.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Conventions and Terminology Used in this Document">
		<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
		"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
		and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
		described in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate
		Requirement Levels" <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="EDNS0 'Owner' Option">
		<t>When a server that supports the DNS-SD Sleep Proxy protocol
		goes to sleep, it communicates relevant DNS records,
		which describe its role on the network, to the Sleep Proxy,
		in one or more DNS Update messages <xref target="RFC2136"/> <xref target="RFC3007"/>.
		Typically these record registrations with the Sleep Proxy do not last forever;
		they have a finite lifetime, communicated using EDNS0 option 2 "DNS Update Lease"
		<xref target="DNS-UL"/>.</t>

		<t>When the Sleep Proxy observes traffic on the network which warrants waking
		the sleeping server, it does so by sending a Wake-on-LAN "Magic Packet"
		<xref target="WoL"/>.</t>

		<t>A Wake-on-LAN "Magic Packet" consists of the following bit-pattern:
			<list style='symbols'>
			<t>Sync sequence: 48 binary 1s (i.e. 6 bytes of 0xFF)</t>
			<t>Sixteen repetitions of the 48-bit MAC address of the sleeping server's network interface</t>
			<t>Optional 32-bit or 48-bit 'password'</t>
			</list>
		</t>

		<t>When the Sleep Proxy determines that the sleeping server has awoken, it can cease
		proxying for that server.</t>

		<t>The Sleep Proxy needs to know the 48-bit MAC address (and possibly 32-bit or
		48-bit 'password') to use to wake the sleeping server.</t>

		<t>It also needs a way to
		determine when the sleeping server has awoken. Because, when a sleeping server
		wakes it may be attached to the network via a different interface (e.g. 802.11
		wireless instead of Ethernet), merely observing the source MAC address in the
		packets it sends may not be sufficient to identify that this server on wireless
		is the same server that moments earlier went to sleep while attached via
		Ethernet. Also, merely observing packets apparently originating from the sleeping
		server may not be sufficient to conclude reliably that it has woken -- since these
		could be old packets, from before it slept, that were delayed in transit.</t>

		<t>The necessary information is communicated in the EDNS0 'Owner' option:
			<list style='symbols'>
			<t>The 48-bit MAC address of the sleeping server's network interface</t>
			<t>Optional 32-bit or 48-bit 'password'</t>
			<t>A 48-bit value that uniquely identifies this machine regardless of which
			interface it is using. Typically the MAC address of the machine's 'primary'
			interface is used for this purpose.</t>
			<t>A sleep/wake sequence number. Each time the server wakes and begins
			a new period of wakefulness, this sequence number is incremented. If the
			Sleep Proxy observes the server send a packet with the same sleep/wake sequence
			number as it saw in the proxy registration, this is an old packet delayed in
			the network and does not constitute evidence that the server has awoken.
			If the Sleep Proxy observes the server send a packet with a different
			sleep/wake sequence number then the Sleep Proxy can conclude that the
			server has awoken and the proxy need not continue answering for it.</t>
			</list>
		</t>

	<section title="EDNS0 'Owner' Option Format">

		<figure>
		<preamble>A full EDNS0 'Owner' option has the following format:</preamble>
<artwork>
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Opt|Len|V|S|Primary MAC|Wakeup MAC |Password   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</artwork>
		</figure>

		<t>The two-byte EDNS0 Option code 'Opt' for the 'Owner' option is 4.</t>
		<t>The two-byte length field 'Len' for this option is 24.</t>
		<t>The one-byte version field 'V' is currently zero. In the current version of
		the protocol, senders MUST set this field to zero on transmission, and receivers
		receiving an EDNS0 option 4 where the version field is not zero MUST ignore
		the entire option.</t>
		<t>The one-byte sequence number field 'S' is set to zero the first time this option
		is used after boot, and then after that incremented each time the machine awakens
		from sleep.</t>
		<t>The six-byte Primary MAC field identifies the machine. Typically, the
		MAC address of the machine's 'primary' interface is used for this purpose.</t>
		<t>The six-byte pattern to be repeated 16 times in the wakeup packet. This SHOULD
		be the MAC address of the interface through which the packet containing this
		'Owner' option is being sent.</t>
		<t>The six-byte 'password' to be appended after the sixteen repetitions of the MAC address.</t>

	<section title="Compact EDNS0 'Owner' Option Formats">

		<figure>
		<preamble>Where the 'password' is only four bytes, a shorter format is used,
		identified by the length field 'Len' having the value 22:</preamble>
<artwork>
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Opt|Len|V|S|Primary MAC|Wakeup MAC |Passwd |   (Len = 22)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</artwork>
		</figure>

		<figure>
		<preamble>When the 'password' is not required, it can be omitted entirely,
		identified by the length field 'Len' having the value 18:</preamble>
<artwork>
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Opt|Len|V|S|Primary MAC|Wakeup MAC |   (Len = 18)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</artwork>
		</figure>

		<figure>
		<preamble>In the common case where the 'password' is not required and the
		Primary MAC and Wakeup MAC are the same, both Wakeup MAC and password may
		be omitted, identified by the length field 'Len' having the value 12:</preamble>
<artwork>
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Opt|Len|V|S|Primary MAC|   (Len = 12)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
